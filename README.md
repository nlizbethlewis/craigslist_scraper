# craigslist_scraper

This scraper boldly delves into the Craigslist Men Seeking Women postings. The men tend to be very very specific about who and want they want, often listing preferred body types, racial preferences, and activities. I was curious to know -  in any given month - what race of woman is most desired on craigslist, and by whom? So I've set up a scraper to pull in all 2500 postings, logging the id's to avoid duplicate postings, and flag postings (using regex) that express a racial preference.
